# KILIL Education Platform - Build Log

## Phase 0: Enterprise Bootstrap

### Assumptions
1. **Country Constraints**: Ethiopia-specific requirements including data residency laws, mobile money integration needs, and USSD limitations
2. **Data Residency**: All student and university data must remain within Ethiopian borders (ASSUMPTION - requires legal verification)
3. **SMS/USSD Aggregator**: Integration with local telecom providers TBD (Ethio Telecom, Safaricom Ethiopia)
4. **Academic Calendar**: Ethiopian calendar system (13 months) integration required
5. **Language Support**: Amharic as primary language with English fallback
6. **Mobile Penetration**: High mobile usage but varying data connectivity
7. **Payment Rails**: Telebirr (Ethio Telecom) as primary mobile money, M-Pesa for cross-border

### Risks and Mitigations

#### High Risk
1. **Data Residency Compliance**
   - Risk: Potential legal issues with data storage location
   - Mitigation: Deploy on Ethiopian cloud providers or on-premise data centers
   - Status: Requires legal review and MoE approval

2. **USSD/SMS Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Delayed integration with telecom providers
   - Mitigation: Build mock services for development, plan phased rollout
   - Status: Need telecom partnership agreements

#### Medium Risk
1. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
   - Risk: Data leakage between universities
   - Mitigation: Implement PostgreSQL RLS + application-level validation
   - Status: Technical solution designed, needs implementation

2. **Ethiopian Calendar Integration**
   - Risk: Date conversion errors affecting academic schedules
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with edge cases, fallback mechanisms
   - Status: Package structure planned

#### Low Risk
1. **Technology Stack Adoption**
   - Risk: Team familiarity with Nx/Next.js/NestJS
   - Mitigation: Documentation, training materials, code examples
   - Status: Well-documented stack with community support

### Key Decisions

#### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo with Nx**: Chosen for code sharing, consistent tooling, and enterprise-scale management
2. **GraphQL at BFF**: Provides flexible API for diverse client needs, reduces over-fetching
3. **PostgreSQL + Redis**: Proven stack with good Ethiopian hosting support
4. **Next.js 14**: Latest features, good Ethiopian font support, SSR for SEO

#### Technology Choices
1. **pnpm over npm/yarn**: Better performance, disk space efficiency, workspace support
2. **TypeScript**: Type safety for enterprise-scale application
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid UI development
4. **shadcn/ui**: Accessible components with Ethiopian localization support

#### Development Practices
1. **Conventional Commits**: Automated versioning and changelog generation
2. **Husky + lint-staged**: Pre-commit code quality enforcement
3. **GitHub Actions**: Native CI/CD integration with security scanning
4. **CodeQL Integration**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities

### Open Questions

#### Technical
1. **Database Sharding Strategy**: By university or geographic region?
2. **CDN Configuration**: Ethiopian CDN providers or international with local POPs?
3. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Self-hosted or managed service within Ethiopia?
4. **Backup Strategy**: Real-time replication vs scheduled backups?

#### Business
1. **University Onboarding Process**: Self-service or manual setup?
2. **Pricing Model**: Per-student, per-university, or hybrid?
3. **Ministry Reporting**: Real-time API or batch file submissions?
4. **Student Data Migration**: Bulk import tools for existing systems?

#### Regulatory
1. **Data Retention Policies**: How long to keep student records?
2. **Privacy Regulations**: Compliance with Ethiopian data protection laws?
3. **Audit Requirements**: Ministry audit trail specifications?
4. **Disaster Recovery**: RTO/RPO requirements for educational data?

### Implementation Timeline

#### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation
- [x] Repository setup and initial commit structure
- [x] Nx monorepo configuration with pnpm
- [x] Basic project structure with apps and packages
- [x] Docker compose setup for local development
- [x] Initial CI/CD pipeline

### CI/CD Setup and Troubleshooting

The initial CI/CD pipeline setup encountered several configuration issues that required systematic debugging. The following fixes were implemented to create a stable and reliable pipeline:

-   **pnpm Setup:** The workflow was updated to use the `pnpm/action-setup` action to ensure `pnpm` is correctly installed before other steps, resolving a "pnpm not found" error.
-   **Dependency Resolution:**
    -   A `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file was created to correctly define the monorepo structure.
    -   All `@nx/*` packages were pinned to a consistent version (`19.8.4`) to fix dependency conflicts.
    -   A `pnpm-lock.yaml` file was generated to ensure deterministic installations.
-   **TypeScript Configuration:**
    -   The base TypeScript configuration was consolidated into the existing `tsconfig.base.json`.
    -   All packages and services were updated to extend this base configuration.
    -   A `tsconfig.json` was created for the `web-portal` app with specific settings for Next.js, including JSX support and types for `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
    -   JavaScript files in `web-portal` were renamed to `.tsx` to align with the TypeScript setup.
-   **Testing Framework:**
    -   Placeholder test files were added to all packages with a `test` script to resolve Jest's "no tests found" error without suppressing it.
    -   The `web-portal` package was configured with a `jest.config.js` to use the `jsdom` environment and a `babel.config.js` for JSX transformation.
    -   The test file in `@kilil/bff` was renamed to match the expected `.spec.ts` pattern.
    -   The `__tests__` directory in `web-portal` was moved out of the `pages` directory to prevent Next.js from building test files as pages.
    -   Jest configurations were updated with `testPathIgnorePatterns` to prevent redundant test runs on compiled `dist` files.
-   **Linting:**
    -   The root `.eslintrc.json` was corrected to use `plugin:@nx/typescript` and `plugin:@nx/javascript`.
    -   A local `.eslintrc.json` was added to the `web-portal` to provide the correct ESLint environment for Next.js and Jest.
    -   `lint` scripts in all service packages were updated to use the correct file paths.
