## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start development environment with Keycloak
./scripts/dev-setup.sh

# Run health checks
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Access web portal at http://localhost:3000
# Access Keycloak at http://localhost:8080
```

## 📋 Repository Information

- **Repository**: `kilil-edu-platform`
- **Owner**: Rick1330
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Branch**: main
- **Tag**: v0.2.0 (Phase 1 complete)

## 🔍 Security Status

## 🌍 Ethiopia-Specific Features

### Identity Management
- **University Roles**: Student, faculty, staff, registrar, bursar
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Campus-specific permissions
- **Local Integration**: Amharic user interface

## 📞 Next Steps

### Phase 2: Minimal Payments E2E (Weeks 5-6)
- Billing service with Account/Charge/Payment/Receipt schema
- Payments adapter with initiate (idempotent) + webhook → billing
- BFF: myBilling query + initiatePayment mutation
- Web: Billing page (balance, receipts, "Pay (stub)" + simulate webhook)
- Billing integration tests (Testcontainers Postgres)
- Docs: Reconciliation spec + ENV updates

### Phase 3: Core Academic Services (Weeks 7-8)
- Student enrollment system
- Course catalog management
- Academic calendar integration
- Notification system

### Phase 4: University Onboarding (Weeks 9-10)
- Multi-tenant provisioning
- Campus management
- Staff training materials

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Authentication Security**: JWT validation with JWKS
- **Role Management**: Well-defined RBAC system
- **Integration Stability**: Proven Keycloak integration

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Scalability**: Performance under high concurrent users
- **Telecom Integration**: SMS-based 2FA dependency
- **University Adoption**: Staff training requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Load Testing**: Performance benchmarks
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Email-based 2FA alternative
- **Training Program**: Comprehensive staff onboarding
